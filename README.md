# TowerQuake
Tower Quake is an asymmetric tower builder earthquake simulator featuring both sound and seismic waves. One player builds up an earthquake by playing a rhythm game with a USB drum set while the other constructs a tower. After a minute, the tower is subjected to the earthquake. Points are awarded based on how many blocks remain on the base at the end of the earthquake.

# Build
